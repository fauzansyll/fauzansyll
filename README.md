I am passionate about enhancing customer acquisition through the development of sophisticated and intuitive graphical user interfaces. My expertise lies in leveraging modern web technologies such as Next.js, React.js, and Firebase to build dynamic and responsive web applications. I am particularly skilled in using Tailwind CSS for streamlined and effective styling.

My journey in Front-end Engineer has been enriched by active participation in informatics engineering events, Google Developer Student Clubs at Mercu Buana University and a few internships for respective role.
