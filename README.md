# Muhamad Fauzan Ibnu Syahlan
 
I am passionate about enhancing customer acquisition through the development of sophisticated and intuitive graphical user interfaces. My expertise lies in leveraging modern web technologies such as Next.js, React.js, and Firebase to build dynamic and responsive web applications. I am particularly skilled in using Tailwind CSS for streamlined and effective styling.

My journey in Front-end Engineer has been enriched by active participation in informatics engineering events, Google Developer Student Clubs at Mercu Buana University and a few internships for respective role. These experiences have honed my technical skills and allowed me to share my knowledge with other engineering communities.

As a dedicated and results-driven professional, I am committed to achieving company objectives and taking on responsibilities with efficiency and precision. I aim to apply my academic and practical knowledge to contribute effectively to a dynamic and innovative team.
